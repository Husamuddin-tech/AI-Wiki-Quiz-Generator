  "summary": "The Internet is a global system of interconnected computer networks that uses the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) to facilitate communication between networks and devices worldwide. It encompasses a vast range of information services and resources, including the World Wide Web, electronic mail, and streaming media, and has profoundly transformed traditional communication, commerce, and personal interaction. While lacking a single centralized governance, key aspects like IP address space and the Domain Name System are managed by organizations such as ICANN and IETF. Its origins trace back to the 1960s with research into time-sharing and packet switching, leading to the development of the ARPANET. Significant milestones include the standardization of TCP/IP in 1982, the emergence of commercial Internet service providers in 1989, and the advent of the World Wide Web by Tim Berners-Lee in the early 1990s. The Internet became fully commercialized in the U.S. by 1995 and has since experienced exponential growth in users, mobile access, and data transmission, becoming a fundamental part of global culture, education, and economy.",

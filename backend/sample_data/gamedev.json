  "summary": "Video game development is a multidisciplinary process encompassing programming, design, art, audio, user interface, and writing, supported by project management and quality assurance. It has evolved from single-person projects in the 1970s, like Pitfall!, to large teams and multi-million dollar budgets for AAA titles today, while also seeing a flourishing of independent and mobile game development. The process typically involves concept, pre-production, full-scale production, and sometimes post-production, with funding often provided by publishers. The article details the historical progression of game development, key figures, and the financial aspects, including revenue distribution and the roles of producers and publishers.",
